# README

Use Ruby v2.7.6 and Rails 7.
Scaffolding is used to generate the entire post object. Use /posts/new and enter input, e.g.: 10 IMG 15 FLAC 13 VID.
the output textarea should display the result.

The logic happens in app/models/post.rb.

The tests are in models/post_test.rb.

Comments:
The document did not provide instruction on displaying individual post pricing. The user may enter 12 IMG. Given the bundles, there is always a remainder of two.
